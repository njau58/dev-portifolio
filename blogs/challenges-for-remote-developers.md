excerpt: 'Working remotely, especially for software teams, is on the rise. Ditching the nine-to-five routine and having the freedom to work from home, the beach, or anywhere else comes with several benefits. However, it also poses some challenges that, if not addressed, can affect the productivity of remote software teams.'

## COMMON REASONS FOR FAILURE IN REMOTE SOFTWARE TEAMS:

1. Communication bottlenecks

Poor communication is one of the biggest roadblocks in a remote software team.
Without clear and lucid communication structures, especially about the three W’s - WHO does WHAT and WHEN - a distributed team cannot function optimally. If communication is not crystal-clear and to the point, misunderstandings can occur within the team and affect the delivery of projects.
### SOLUTION

To reduce miscues and misinterpretations, team members should communicate frequently, provide regular updates about their allocated tasks, and ask for clarification whenever necessary.

2. Isolation

Working remotely without having sufficient social interactions can make employees feel lonely and detached. In fact, according to a study on the state of remote work, 21% of freelancers and employees believe that loneliness is the biggest struggle with working virtually.
### SOLUTION

To avoid feeling isolated, engineers working virtually should make time for human interaction.

3. Technical hiccups 

Remote teams have to rely on technology to make things happen. Therefore, unreliable or poor technology makes it difficult for a remote team to achieve its goals.
### SOLUTION

It’s important for organizations to invest in comprehensive technical setups that can support the functions of distributed teams.

4. Interruptions 

When working remotely, interruptions are sometimes unavoidable. For example, during a live video call, a colleague’s kid may burst through the door, a dog may bark uncontrollably, or the doorbell might ring.
### SOLUTION

Designating a working space and communicating your work schedule with others.

5. Absence of a remote culture

It’s harder to build a company culture where team members are far away from each other, but it’s worth doing. Success in remote work requires a culture of discipline, thoroughness, and responsiveness.

Remote software teams can be very effective at creating great products and propelling a company’s growth. However, such teams need to avoid some common pitfalls that may prevent them from accruing the benefits of working remotely.
